    <main>
    
    
        <p>Using this guide, You'll have your own A.I chatbot running in no time, without any Wi-Fi or cloud-buzz-words, credit to NeuralNine on YT</p>
        <h1>Dependencies</h1>
        <p>- Python</p>
        <p>- pip</p>
        <p>- tensorflow</p>
        <p>- nltk</p>
        <p>Note: This cannot run in a virtual enviroment, as Tensorflow will give you a "illegal hardware instruction" error</p>

        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>You will need to create two python files and one JSON file as your database for training, Here are the download link for the files</p>
        <a href="training.py">training.py</a>
        <hr>
        <a href="chatbot.py">chatbot.py</a>
        <hr>
        <a href="intents.json">intents.json</a>

        <p>Once you download them, run the training.py file, It will create a neural network with 200 epochs, Using the intents.json, The model will try and learn from it, This will take either a couple of seconds or minutes depending on your system's hardware</p>
        <p>Now, after the neural network is finished, Run the chatbot.py file, After some checking, the bot should respond with Hello World</p>
        <p>And that's it, You have your own chatbot model to play around with, The only problem is getting a big enough intents.json file, as the more data to train on the better the model is</p>
